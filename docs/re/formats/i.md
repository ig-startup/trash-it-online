# `.I` — per-object shape index — **Confirmed**

4 bytes per object, in the same order as the `.WAM` records. First u16
is the `.G2` shape index; second u16 is 0 or 1 (flag, meaning not
pinned down). This is the indirection that lets several objects of the
same *type* (same size/strength) wear different graphics.
